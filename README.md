ROCK, PAPER, SCISSORS
PART OF THE ODIN PROJECT JAVASCRIPT FOUNDATIONS COURSE

Hello! My name is Jessi B.

This game of Rock, Paper, Scissors is an introductory Javascript assignment within 
the Odin Project foundations course. The goal of this program is to allow the user
to play five rounds of Rock, Paper, Scissors against the computer. The round winner's 
score will increment by one with each win. After five rounds, the game will 
terminate and announce an overall winner based on the scores.

Because this in an introductory assignment, the program runs completely within the
console rather than integrated into the webpage using interactive elements such as 
CSS styling. This will be added in a later Odin course.

Thanks for viewing!
